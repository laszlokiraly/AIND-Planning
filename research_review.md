# Research Review
After completing the coding and analysis portion of the project, read up on important historical developments in the field of AI planning and search. Write a one-page report on three of these developments, highlighting the relationships between the developments and their impact on the field of AI as a whole.

Appropriate sources (such as books or magazine or journal articles) should be cited, and you should use citations in-line for sourced facts, quotations, and inferences.

Save your review as research_review.pdf in the same folder as your code.

[Tip: The book Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Norvig and Russell is chock full of references in the Bibliographical and Historical notes at the end of Chapter 10.]


## remarks
from readme.md:

  Even though PDDL uses variable to describe actions as "action schema", these problems are not solved with First Order Logic. They are solved with Propositional logic and must therefore be defined with concrete (non-variable) actions and literal (non-variable) fluents in state descriptions.

-> First Order Logic vs Propositional logic
